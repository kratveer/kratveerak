                 Quantum Information and Computation is a promising field of research that exploits some of the fundamental features of quantum world like superposition, entanglement and non-locality in quantum information processing. In the last three decades there have been major developements in the area of quantum computing, quantum teleportation, remote state preparation, quantum cryptography, quantum communication and so on. We can safely say that the future revolution in information technology will be largely based on quantum information science. <br> <br>



                 Current research topics include all aspects of quantum information, in particular quantum entanglement, quantum correlations, quantum speed limit, weak measurements, stronger uncertainty relations, monogmy and polygamy of various correlation measures, quantum coherence, entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum theory and their consequences. I have been also collaborating with experimentalists to test some of our theoretical predictions.

               <p>Quantum theory is based on few postulates, yet it has a very rich structure and amazing predictive power. Whatever is allowed by the rules of quantum mechanics that is going to happen sooner or later (it is a matter of technological development). Below you will find that some of our quantum predictions have been experimentally tested. </p>
               <li>We have proved the no-deletion theorem in quantum information theory. This is also known as the Pati-Braunstein theorem in the literature. Like the no-cloning theorem this is another fundamental limitation on quantum information. This says that given two identical copies of an unknown quantum state we cannot delete a copy against the other. This has opened up a new direction of research. It has gone into text books of quantum information theory and is part of regular course at many Universities (eg Stanford University). </li>
               
            
               <li>Along with other collaborators (E. Sjoqvist, A. Ekert, J. S. Anandan, M. Ericsson, D. K. L. Oi and V.Vedral) we have introduced the concept of geometric phase for mixed states undergoing unitary time evolution. This has opened up another direction of research. Recently, several groups have experimentally tested our geometric phase for mixed quantum states. These ideas may play an important role in geometric quantum computation. </li>
                    
               <li>We have proposed the exact remote state preparation (RSP) protocol for special class of qubits. Using this protocol one can prepare a known qubit with the help of one EPR state and communication of one classical bit. Also, we have shown that any single qubit measurement statistics can be simulated for any arbitrary qubit at a remote location using one EPR pair and one classical bit. This is called remote state measurement (RSM). Like quantum teleportation, RSP has become another quantum communication protocol. Recently, several groups have verified our RSP protocol for special class of qubit states. </li>
               <li>We have shown the necessity of quantum entanglement in Grover's algorithm in pure state and pseudo-pure state implementations. Earlier there have been doubts whether one needs entanglement or just linear superposition would be enough to achieve the speed-up. </li>
               <li>In collaboration with S. L. Braunstein we have proved the no-hiding theorem for quantum information and its robustness to imperfect hiding process. Accordingly, if the original quantum information is missing from one subsystem then it must be found in the reminder of the subsystem and moreover this cannot be hidden in the correlations. This has several applications that includes quantum teleportation, any physical process leading to thermalization and black hole information loss paradox. </li>
               <li>Recently, Anil Kumar and his group has experimentally tested the no-hiding theorem in state randomization of an arbitrary qubit. When a qubit in a pure state is randomized it is transformed to a completely random mixture. In this process the original information is completely lost from the system. However, in accordance with the no-hiding theorem the lost information is indeed recovered from the ancilla qubits using NMR setup. This experiment constitute the first experimental test of conservation of quantum information. </li>
               <li>Heisenberg-Robertson's uncertainty relation expresses a limitation in the possible preparations of the system by giving a lower bound to the product of the variances of two observables in terms of their commutator. However, it does not capture the concept of incompatible observables because it can be trivial, i.e., the lower bound can be null even for two non-compatible observables. ALong with L. Maccone we have proved two stronger uncertainty relations, relating to the sum of variances, whose lower bound is guaranteed to be nontrivial whenever the two observables are incompatible on the state of the system. Recently, the new uncertainty relations have been tested in experiment. This is also highlighted in NATURE ASIA.</li>
