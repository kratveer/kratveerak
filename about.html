          <div class="aboutbiography"> <b>Arun Kumar Pati</b> is a Professor in Quantum Information and Computation Group, at Harish Chandra Research Institute, Allahabad. Before joining here he was a scientist at Theoretical Physics Division, BARC, Mumbai, India from 1989-2010. During his tenure at BARC he was a visiting scientist at University of Wales, Bangor, UK from 1998-2000. Then he was on deputation to Institute of Physics, Bhubaneswar, India from 2001-2010. He has visited and delivered talks at many Universities and Institutes including University of Bristol, UK, MSRI, Berkely, University of California, MIT, Boston, USA, Bell Lab, NJ, USA, Naval Research Lab, Washington DC, USA, JPL, NASA, USA, University of South Carolina, USA, University of New Mexico, USA, Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, Canada and many more. <br><br>

           His research areas include all aspects of quantum information and quantum computation, the theory of geometric phases and its applications, and the foundations of quantum mechanics. Among his important discoveries are the No-Deletion theorem, Geometric Phases for mixed state, Remote State Preparation protocol, the No-Hiding Theorem and the Stronger Uncertainty Relations in quantum mechanics. The no-deleting theorem can be found in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_no-deleting_theorem">Wikipedia</a>. He has more than 150 research papers in international journals and conferences on these topics. He has edited two books: (i) Quantum Information with Continuous Variables and (ii) Quantum Aspects of Life. His research papers have been highlighted in NATURE, NATURE ASIA, SCIENCE, and many national and international newspapers.</div> <br><br>
